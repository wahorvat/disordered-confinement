## Quick Intro and Simple Example

- [ ] Theory framework - quasicrystals/hyperuniformity/RMT/translating topological nonlinear phenomena to time domain in 2D systems(particularly light-matter states in large unit cells) - Boundary between hyperuniform types results in confinement by methods discussed in topological graphs paper
- [ ] Numerical methods for allowed modes in disordered system and lifetime/evolution of modes
- [ ] Visualizations
